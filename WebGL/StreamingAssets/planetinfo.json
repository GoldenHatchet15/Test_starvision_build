               "Name": "Sun",
               "Biography": "The Sun, the star at the center of our solar system, is the most important source of energy for life on Earth. With a rotation period of approximately 609.12 hours at the equator, the Sun's rotation varies due to its gaseous nature, with the poles rotating more slowly. It travels through space at an average speed of 220 km/s within the Milky Way galaxy. The Sun is located about 0 km from the center of the solar system, as it is the central anchor around which all planets orbit. It has a radius of 696,340 kilometers and an immense mass of 1.989 \u00d7 10^30 kg, resulting in a surface gravity of 274 m/s\u00b2. The Sun's surface temperature is around 5778 K, producing light and heat through nuclear fusion processes in its core. This fusion converts hydrogen into helium, releasing energy that radiates outwards and sustains life on Earth. The Sun's immense energy output and its influence on the solar system's structure make it a vital object of study in astronomy and astrophysics."
